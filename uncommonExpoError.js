This error typically occurs when you have an issue with your Expo project's configuration or dependencies.  It's often related to mismatched versions of packages or incorrect settings in your `app.json` or `expo.json` file.  For instance, an incompatibility between your Expo SDK version and the versions of other packages you're using (like React Native Navigation or Async Storage) can trigger this. Another potential cause involves issues with your project's build process, such as missing native modules or problems with your development environment.  The error message itself is quite generic, so pinpointing the exact cause usually requires careful debugging.
