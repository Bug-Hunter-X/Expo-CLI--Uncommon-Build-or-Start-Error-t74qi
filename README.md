# Expo CLI: Uncommon Build or Start Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet difficult-to-diagnose error encountered with the Expo CLI. The error message is often generic, making it challenging to pinpoint the root cause.  This example showcases potential scenarios and solutions.

**Scenario:**

The project fails to start or build with a vague error message from the Expo CLI.  This might indicate various problems such as dependency conflicts, mismatched versions, or incorrect configurations.

**Solution:**

The solution involves carefully inspecting the project setup, dependencies, and configuration files (`app.json` or `expo.json`).  The debugging process might include checking dependency versions for compatibility, ensuring native modules are correctly installed, and examining the Expo CLI logs for more detailed error messages. Sometimes, reinstalling node modules or cleaning the project's cache can resolve the issue.

**Files:**

- `uncommonExpoError.js`: Demonstrates a project setup that might trigger the error.
- `uncommonExpoErrorSolution.js`: Shows the corrected setup and debugging steps.
